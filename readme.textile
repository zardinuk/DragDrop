h4. Notice

The change to version 0.2.1-beta is *NOT* backwards compatible. Make sure to look over the samples below.

h2. Features

* Simple and intuitive interface
* Option to seperate the event target from the dragged element
* Bindable dragstart/drag/dragend events
* Option to define bounding boxes (*new* in version 0.2.1-beta)
* Very lightweight (only 1.8kb minified and gzipped)

h2. Samples! :)

<pre><code>// Make myElement drag-and-drop enabled
var draggable = DragDrop.draggable({
    element: myElement,
    // The anchor; myElement moves when anotherElement is dragged
    anchor: anotherElement,
    // The draggable element will now stay bound within it's offsetParent
    boundingBox: 'offsetParent'
});

// Change the bounding box to some manual positions
draggable.setBoundingBox({
    x: { min: 0, max: 600 },
    y: { min: 0, max: 400 }
});

// Define a new dragend event (using Backbone.Events)
draggable.bind('dragend', function(evt) {
    // ...
});

// This is how you would remove a drag event (if one were defined above)
draggable.unbindEvent('drag', theBoundDragEventFunction);</code></pre>
